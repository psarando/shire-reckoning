# What's this all about?

As mentioned in the Shire Reckoning notes on
"[Reckoning with moon phases](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#reckoning-with-moon-phases)",
it is demonstrated in [The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#references)
that Tolkien used the actual moon phases of 1941-1942 as a reference when describing the moon (or lack of moon) during certain events in
[The Lord of the Rings](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#references),
but these moon phases only align with the dates in the narrative if those Shire Calendar dates start reckoning their year
from December 25 in 1940 and 1941.
Also mentioned in those notes is the concept that
[moon phases repeat on approximately the same dates every 19 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle),
and these 1941-2 moon phases repeated on most of the same dates in 2017-18
(with some falling [1 day earlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callippic_cycle)).

So starting in the spring of 2017 (or really the previous fall) I led myself and my brother in a "Lunar Readalong",
re-reading LOTR in "real-time" in 2017-18, according to the moon phases and approximately at the same time-of-year as described in the story,
with the help of *The Lord of the Rings* Appendix B, the *Reader's Companion*, and this project's
[Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html).

I also posted my progress to the
[/r/tolkienfans subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/63kee3/lotr_lunar_readalong_chapter_2_april_5_6_and_more/),
and along the way I made some notes on some of my real-world observations of the moon on those dates.
I have collected my results here, along with the alignment for 2020-21 dates and moon phases.

A
[shortcut to the calendar simulations that defaults to syncing with the moon phases for 2017-18 and today's date](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/examples/?path=/story/shire-reckoning-middle-earth-simulation--2017-18-moon-phase-synchronized-simulation)
is still available,
as well as a
[shortcut to the simulations that sync with the moon phases for 2020-21](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/examples/?path=/story/shire-reckoning-middle-earth-simulation--2020-21-moon-phase-synchronized-simulation)
(both are also accessible from the [examples page](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/examples/)).

## 2020-21 Readalong with Illustrated Blog Posts

I'm now in the process of repeating this Readalong for the
[2020-21 moon phases](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/examples/?path=/story/shire-reckoning-middle-earth-simulation--2020-21-moon-phase-synchronized-simulation)
(which I think fit the story even better than the 2017-18 moon phases),
so expect some of the [scheme and my notes](#lunar-readalong-grand-scheme)
to be updated throughout.

I'm also [publishing blog posts](https://shirereckoningproject.wordpress.com/)
on some of the key dates when the moon is mentioned in the story,
with [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/)
simulations of exactly what the moon should have looked like
(using the moon phases of 1941-42).

This is similar to what has already been done at
[Shire-Reckoning.com's Moon Phases in The Lord of the Rings](http://shire-reckoning.com/moon.html),
but my blog posts will include fuller quotes from *The Lord of the Rings*,
and are hopefully better illustrated by the [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/) simulations
(not to mention my posts will be published on the corresponding real-world dates of the Readalong).

So please follow along at
[The Shire Reckoning Project's Lunar Read-along blog](https://shirereckoningproject.wordpress.com/),
where you can also subscribe to be notified of every new post!

## Future Readalongs

If anyone else wishes to attempt this Readalong in the future,
a close approximation can probably be achieved in any year by aligning the full moon nearest to the beginning of March with Rethe 8
(the moon phase that is probably more important to the story than any other moon phase described).
Although our friends in the Southern Hemisphere may wish to align the full moon nearest to the end of August with Rethe 8.

This project's [Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html)
can help align the Shire dates with the dates in our calendar in that year.
See the directions on [how to use the Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#how-to-use-these-calendar-simulations),
and also the [Moon phases](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#moon-phases)
"Synchronize settings", for more details and directions on how to align Shire dates for a different year.

# Caveats

This is **not recommended for first-time readers**,
and needless to say **this page will contain book spoilers**.

Even though I found it interesting to re-read the story in chronological order,
while observing the real-world moon along with the descriptions of it in the story,
those who have already read *The Lord of the Rings* before might not want to read to such a sparse schedule,
or rearranged from its original, "overlapping" order the way Tolkien meant it to be read.

At the beginning of the *Reader's Companion* Book Three, Chapter 1,
Hammond and Scull quote Richard C. West, who,
"in 'The Interlace Structure of *The Lord of the Rings*', *A Tolkien Compass* (1975),
points out that this overlapping or 'interlacing' was a medieval form of storytelling":

> Interlace... seeks to mirror the perception of the flux of events in the world around us,
> where everything is happening at once...
> Also, the narrator implies there are innumerable events that he has not had time to tell us about...
> Yet the apparently casual form of the interlace is deceptive: it actually has a very subtle kind of cohesion.
> No part of the narrative can be removed without damage to the whole...

Which I think emphasizes again that attempting to read *The Lord of the Rings* in chronological order is
**not recommended for first-time readers**.

With that said, perhaps this Readalong chart could still help those who are re-reading *The Lord of the Rings* in its original order,
and want to cross-reference previous chapters of the story to see what else was happening at the same time
as the passage they are currently reading.

Perhaps this project can also spark some curiosity in amateur astronomy for those who might not usually pay attention to the real-world moon.
Then they can use this scheme to observe the real-world moon themselves,
during a similar time of year as in the story,
and they can see just how the moon would have looked to the story's characters,
or when it would have risen or set over certain events (give or take an hour).
As noted above, they would have to align the full moon nearest to the beginning of March with Rethe 8,
and use this project's [Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html)
to align all the other Shire dates with the dates in our calendar in that year.

# Format of this Lunar Readalong Scheme

## Key to the Moon Phase Emojis

I'm including an emoji for the appropriate moon phase for certain dates in the first column of this table.
If the event for that day includes any mention of the moon on that date,
then I'll include the appropriate moon phase emoji in the first column of that event's row.
If the date is on one of the moon's quarter phases (new 🌑 / 1st 🌓 / full 🌕 / last 🌗),
or maybe if the event for that day does not mention the moon but mentions the night sky,
then I'll include the appropriate moon phase emoji in parentheses in this column.

|Emoji|Moon phase description|
| --- | -------------------- |
|🌑|new moon|
|🌒|waxing crescent|
|🌓|1st quarter|
|🌔|waxing gibbous|
|🌕|full moon|
|🌖|waning gibbous|
|🌗|last quarter|
|🌘|waning crescent|

## Shire Month Emoji Links

The 2nd column includes an [appropriate emoji for the month](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#shire-months)
of that event's Shire Calendar date.
This emoji is also a direct link to that event in this scheme.

## Shire date

The 3rd column gives the date of the event according to Shire Reckoning,
and [each Shire month is given in its "original" name](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#shire-reckoning-notes)
in order to avoid confusion with the Gregorian calendar month names for the dates given in the
[2020-21 Alignment](#2020-21-alignment) column.

A specific date is not always given for some events,
so those dates will be marked with `(approximate)` to indicate that the event occurred near that date.

Often a character will recount past events to the other characters of the story.
I've listed many of those events here on the date the event originally took place on,
and not on the date that character is recalling the event.
So dates marked with `(retrospect)` indicate that date is the original date of that event.

## 2020-21 Alignment

The scheme includes an example alignment for dates and moon phases in 2020-21.

As mentioned above, a close approximation of aligning the moon phases in a different year
can probably be achieved by aligning the full moon nearest to the beginning of March with Rethe 8
(the moon phase that is probably more important to the story than any other moon phase described).
Although our friends in the Southern Hemisphere may wish to align the full moon nearest to the end of August with Rethe 8.

See the directions on [how to use the Middle-earth calendar simulations](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#how-to-use-these-calendar-simulations),
and also the [Moon phases](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#moon-phases)
"Synchronize settings", for more details and directions on how to align Shire dates for a different year.

I'm including real-world 2019 dates for Chapter 1 that should be close to the same time of year
and to what the moon phase should be in that part of the story.
The real-world 2019 dates also let 6 months stand-in for the 17-year gap of the story.

## Book.Chapter

I'm using Book and Chapter notation where "Book 1, Chapter 1" is `I.1`, and "Book 6, Chapter 9" is `VI.9`.

## Page Start

Page numbers are as given in the *Reader's Companion*,
which are either for the 2005 single volume,
or for the previous standard 3-volume hardback editions (such as the 1965 publication).
The *Reader's Companion* 3-volume page numbers are given as `Volume:Page`,
so the end of the story is listed as `1031 (III:311)`,
which is page 1031 in the single-volume edition, or Volume III page 311 of the 3-volume edition.
Hopefully using Roman numerals also for the [Book.Chapter](#bookchapter) notation isn't too confusing.

## Read until

Since not everyone can use these page numbers,
a snippet of the passage where I think the story ends on each date is also listed.

Since [Shire dates are reckoned from midnight to midnight](https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/Middle-earth-simulation.html#reckoning-the-start-or-end-of-a-day)
(just like our modern dates),
I've put each cutoff as close to midnight as possible.
I'll leave it to the discretion of the reader to decide when to read pre-dawn events past the midnight cutoffs,
since some events span an entire night
(for example the snowstorm on Caradhras is mostly in the pre-dawn hours of Afteryule 12).

For anyone who is curious,
the amount to read on the day of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Rethe 15, was second only to the reading on Rethe 5,
the day of the parley with Saruman in Orthanc and when Pippin looks into palantír.
Using the 1965 edition as reference, it was about 50 vs. 60 pages
(or more if you read past the midnight cutoffs until the story gets to morning, as I've tended to do).

Since the readings on these dates were mostly action and dialog,
I thought they were fairly quick readings anyway.

## Event Summary

A summary of the events for each date is provided, and is usually just quoted from *The Tale of Years* (Appendix B).
If no summary is provided for that date in Appendix B, then I try to use a quote from the story,
otherwise I'll provide my own summary.

## Notes

As mentioned above,
I made some notes as I read along with the 2017-18 scheme on some of my real-world observations of the moon for some dates.
Those notes are provided in the last column of the scheme below,
along with various other notes for certain events.

It's interesting that the hobbits decided to leave Rivendell during the Enderi, which were likely holidays and a time of celebration for the Elves. The story doesn't mention anything about this holiday, but I could still speculate that the holiday might have played a part in their decision to leave: Maybe they wanted to leave then because the Elvish holiday reminded them of the holidays they were missing at home? Or maybe they decided to leave in the middle of the Enderi since that's how they wanted to remember Rivendell, during a time of festival.

We know there were at least 3 Enderi (Middle-days) of the Calendar of Imladris that year, ending on this date, but if it happened to be a leap-year in that Elvish calendar, there would have been 3 more after that (each leap-year has 3 leap-days since the Calendar of Imladris has a leap-year only once every 12 years).
